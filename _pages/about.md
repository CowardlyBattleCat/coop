This blog is the informal and conversational outlet for the The [Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html) at Fred Hutch. The Coop, for short, is a cooperative that includes all groups and individuals at Fred Hutch interested in bioinformatics and data science. Started at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), The Coop aims to address duplication of effort, wasted resources including time and money, lack of shared knowledge and best practices, and lost collaboration opportunities as it relates to data science. This blog is wonderfully created and maintained by [our contributors]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributors/). Read [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/coop/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you too would like to contribute.
