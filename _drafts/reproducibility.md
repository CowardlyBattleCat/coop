## What is reproducibility in the context of computational research and/or data analysis?

Define open science, reproducibility
reproducibility as a continuum
software and environment vs data analysis

set of instructions to recreate research results
accessibility (ease of obtaining code/data) and ease of re-running
levels of reproducibility: same person at a later time, other person in same lab, anyone in science? 

reproducibility takes time
surrounding culture, tends to note that reproducibility is good, but why?
compare to reproducibility in lab experiments
involvement in open science

## What's the best place to get started improving reproducibility in data analysis?

[Coding habits for data scientists](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists) by David Tan
functions 
code review
will this be recognizable to everyone else? conventions and standards

history from command line, convert to script
easing entry points for sharing resources among lab members
workflow tools
test driven development, type driven development
document along the way!
workflow managers

institutional support (tools, training) for reproducibility
reward structure for reproducibility: pace of work, cost of learning vs productivity, reducing complexity of development over time, citations, institutional leaderboard?
