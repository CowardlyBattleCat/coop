Fred Hutch is currently evaluating its approach to supporting data-intensive research (often called data science). As part of this work, we ran a “customer survey” in January to help tell the story of the [Coop](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html) and [fredhutch.io](https://www.fredhutch.io/). We sent the survey out to our community via Slack, email, and word of mouth, and our response rate wasn’t too shabby given the short turnaround. We had 53 respondents from a range of divisions and groups:

| **Group** | **# of Respondents**
| --- | :---:
| Basic Sciences Division | 2
| Human Biology Division | 4
| Public Health Sciences Division | 6
| Clinical Research Division | 9
| Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division | 14
| Administrative Division | 7
| SCCA | 2
| UW | 1

We asked three sets of questions to get information on (1) use of resources generated by Coop and fredhutch.io, (2) the impact/importance of Coop and fredhutch.io, and (3) general comments and thoughts. 

### Use of Resources ###
“In the last 6 months, how often have you attended or engaged in the following Coop-supported activities?”

### Impact ###
“Indicate your level of agreement with the following statements”

### Comments ###
We received dozens of comments from respondents about the impact of the Coop and fredhutch.io. A few of our favorites:

- “Every code issue I've posted on the Slack channel has been responded to within a few hours, and usually solved in a day or two.”
- “The Coop has been a fantastic resource for networking. I wish it had existed when I started at the Hutch over 7 years ago.”
- “I have found a community of like-minded folks that care as much about programming as they do the data and getting results. I have attended multiple meetings where I was able to get interesting ideas that improved my approach to a problem and share my ideas to help others resolve their issues. By getting out of our silos, I believe my life as a Hutchian has been much improved.”
- “I believe that an organization like The Coop is essential for the continued success of the center as a whole, as well as myself as an individual researcher.”
- “The Coop is awesome! Love how it brings all the data/viz/informatics people together and also connects us with resources in the form of SciComp staff (who are amazing) + training opportunities. Thank you for your efforts.”
