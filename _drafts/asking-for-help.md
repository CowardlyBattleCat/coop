As some of us find ourselves with extra time on our hands in the COVID-19 era many at Fred Hutch are looking to sharpen their programming skills. Luckily, we have some amazing opportunities and resources to learn digitally through The Coop, TDS-IRC, and FredHutch.io. A natural consequence of more people learning to code is that we've seen an increase in messages related to looking for coding help via slack channels, community groups, and personal messages to folks like Kate and myself. We've noticed a stark difference in how seasoned and newer programmers will structure their messages seeking help. Someone newer to programming may send a message that goes something like this: `Hi, I can't install tidyverse. Can you please help?`. While there is nothing technically wrong with asking for help this way - it will take a few back and forth messages, possibly running some code again, to diagnose the issue. In this post we will go over some norms and best-practices for asking for coding help through slack, email, or online forum.

First, I want to note that a fear of asking for help can be compounded by very real oppressive structures and lived experience. Women, gender-diverse folks, and people of color experience vitriol online at higher rates. Further, these groups often encounter increased scrutiny at work that can make regularly asking for help more intimidating and possibly detrimental to career progress. It's important to cultivate a work environment that actively addresses power structures to create a space that encourages open, vulnerable communication and where asking for help feels comfortable to all.

1. **Do some research before posting/asking**

- The first step to encountering a problem is trying to solve it or at least understand it as much as you can on your own. Toss your error code on google, peruse help forums, try a few solutions. 

- *Best case scenario:* Someone has already asked your exact question and the solution provided works for you! It's good practice to double-check that your question has not already been answered in an internet forum before posting.

- *Worst case scenario:* No working results turn up. While this can be a frustrating process it will help you further diagnose your problem (if only by determining what doesn't work) and enable you to describe the situation more clearly. 

2. **Clearly state your problem**

- The quality of the answers you receive is directly related to the quality of the question posed. A good question is concise and systematically addresses the problem. Make sure that before posting any code that you properly introduce and give context to the question you are asking. Enough detail should be provided that someone could answer you without requesting more information.

3. **Make sure your problem is reproducible**

- It is best practice to provide a minimal reproducible example of the code that you need help with. An ideal example uses the minimal amount of code required to reproduce the problem and includes all the parts necessary to reproduce the problem including inputs and desired output. The test code should reliably reproduce the problem you're trying to solve. 

- Do not use images of code. Copy and paste text and then format it as code. It helps with readability and makes it easier to run your test code.

- Make sure that the code you show doesn't contain any sensitive information like personal information, passcodes, etc.

4. **Be nice!**

- Generally, the people you're going to for help are unpaid and volunteering their time and expertise. Kindness and understanding go a long way. 

- Try and remember there are real humans behind the screen and brush off folks who may be less than welcoming.

5. **Archive your discussion so it can be useful to others**

- No one else should have to suffer through pages of purple links to find the answer they're looking for. It's always good practice to share back what you've learned. 

- If you have requested help through a forum and a response solved your problem make sure you go back and mark the correct answer to let folks know what worked. It can even be helpful to note what answers did not work for you and why.

While this post generally focuses on getting help through online forums many of these tips apply when asking for help in person as well. For more in-depth information on effectively asking for coding help check out these two articles:
