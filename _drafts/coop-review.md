In July of 2018, I found myself at a Mexican restaurant, sitting across the booth from a friend-of-a-friend and future colleague, Kate Hertweck. I hadnâ€™t yet started at Fred Hutch, and Kate had only been there a few weeks, but we both agreed we were going to bring positive change to the organization.

Over the first few months of our tenure at Fred Hutch, we shared information, tagged along to meetings, and compared our findings about the culture of the Hutch. We shared philosophies about the importance of community, the value of training, and the promise of open science. This led us to creating what is now known as The Coop.

The Coop was never intended to replace any organization at the Hutch; rather our goal was to build a community around data-intensive efforts where everyone was encouraged to participate, irrespective of position, level of expertise, or area of research. I had seen these types of connections result in better research and new collaborations at other organizations, and was optimistic that the timing was right for the Hutch community.

In the 14 months since The Coop was launched, we have made great strides in our goals. Our successes can be attributed it part to support from leadership that resulted in dedicated space (Coop Lab), and budget for events, seminars, and trainings. We also have some rockstar community members and amazing dedicated staff (thanks Justin, Thomas, and Anders!).

In October, we consolidated the Coop and fredhutch.io, the Hutch training program, under a single organizational group to simplify operations. It made sense to combine Coop and fredhutch.io since both are working to support researchers engaged in data-intensive research.

As we enter 2020, Kate and I are excited about the possibilities for growing the Coop community. We also want to reflect on our successes from the previous 14 months, so here are some stats for your consideration:
- The Coop has hosted more than 20 events, including guest speakers, community meetings, panels, trainings, social hours, and interest groups.
- The Coop Launch (Oct 2018) and Coop Anniversary Party (Nov 2019) both had more than 100 attendees.
- Our monthly newsletter has 330 subscribers (email coophelp at fredhutch.org to subscribe!)
- The Coop facilitates hosting of 6-10 standing events weekly, including office hours, courses, and interest groups
- The Coop Slack channel has 320 members, ~120 of which are active on a weekly basis
- fredhutch.io has taught more than 300 people in 24 different sessions. fredhutch.io has also hosted two Carpentries bootcamps.
