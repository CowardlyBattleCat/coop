From 2016 to now [Fredhutch.IO](https://www.fredhutch.io/resources/) has taught roughly 342 Fred Hutch employees in the _Introduction to R_ course and since the middle of 2018, 245 in the _Introduction to Python_. In those introductory courses we use integrated development environments or IDEs like Rstudio and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) respectively yet, they are not the only ones. Even though [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) is the most popular one for R and used by most the same cannot be said for Python. In the [_Python User Group_](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/#community-groups), we recently looked at some of the other popular IDEs for python.
