The number of jobs requiring technical skills in data-intensive research are increasing at the Hutch. It's difficult to recruit for technical positions here, and once hired, the experiences of employees in highly technical jobs is very heterogeneous. This panel discussion will focus on the interview process, but I'm happy to include discussion of other issues related to employment of technical staff on campus.

- Introduce yourself (name, position at Fred Hutch, relevant work experience at other places if applicable)

- What is a technical interview? How do they work in practice? (this may also involve a description of how hiring works in your group)

- How do you assess technical skills during an interview?

- What types of bias can arise in technical interviews? How can we minimize this bias?

- Discussions about hiring often include work culture and whether someone is a "good fit" for the position. How does this affect hiring for a technical position in which someone may possess very different skills than the rest of the group?

- What types of support would assist in recruiting and hiring for technical positions?

- What would help support individuals in technical positions once they are employed at the Hutch?
