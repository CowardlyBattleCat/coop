I was pleased to represent Fred Hutch in late January at [rstudio::conf2020](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/07/15/rstudio-conf-2020/) in San Francisco. In addition to having used RStudio as my interface for R statistical programming for the last several years, I've long admired the company's commitment to open-source software and education. To that end, the workshop materials are publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020), and videos of all talks will eventually be available on [RStudio's resources page](https://resources.rstudio.com). If you're interested in what other people thought about the conference, I also highly recommend the [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstudioconf2020)!

My own presentation focused on community building among researchers interested in developing their R coding skills, so I attended most of the conference sessions focused on education. Here are some of the projects I found most exciting:
- Teacups, Giraffes, and Statistics https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html
- TidyBlocks http://tidyblocks.tech
- [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/index.html) [Using Data Science to Create Economic Opportunities in Baltimore](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZMrlruXg5yZJPEdKVt5wyMwG89k2e8_maPuFhQwf5u0/edit#slide=id.p)

Data visualization tips
- rayshader package for 3D plots
- gifski package creates gifs using purrr
- reduce clutter by adding whitespace and linebreaks
- a little knowledge about typesetting can go a long way! [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)
- color theory, my personal favorite is [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org)
- Rmarkdown themes, gallery [here](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
