## What is Slack?

At the Coop, or the [Fred Hutch Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html), we use Slack to facilitate communication among our community of researchers interested in data-intensive research. [Slack](https://slack.com) is an online discussion platform used by many organizations and teams in tech communities. Different groups within and outside the Hutch maintain a Slack workspace of their own. [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) is a great place to learn about events and resources relevant to data-intensive research, ask questions about particular tools or approaches, and meet other Hutch researchers working on topics similar to you.

If you're brand new to Slack, we recommend heading over to Slack's [_Getting Started_](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-getting-started-for-new-members) page for a quick overview. Otherwise, check out the overview below for a quick orientation to the Coop Communities workspace.

## Joining the Coop Communities Slack workspace

Once you have installed and launched Slack it’s time to join some communities here at the Hutch by [click here](https://fhbig.slack.com/) and joining the `fhbig.slack.com` workspace. Anyone who has `@fredhutch.org`, `@sagebase.org`, `@scharp.org` and `@uw.edu` email addresses can join without invitation and the list can be expanded upon request. 

Once in the workspace you can access online channels, discussions, and communities here at the Hutch. Slack facilitates communication via community channels, which can be public or private, and direct messages.

_Channels_, which most are open, help you organize conversations around a topic or project within the workspace. When you make a channel, then everyone can see the conversation and what is discussed in that channel. It’s a good idea to create channels for different projects, topics, or a conversation between team members. You can also create private channels if you want to have a private discussion with just a few team members. Additionally, you can direct message a member which works like email reaching a member or multiple members quickly and directly.

## What Slack channels are available?

Click the plus sign next to "Channel" on the sidebar to search for existing channels. Then select the channel of interest you want to join. Below are some channels at the Hutch that you may want to join. These channels are designed to help create and support the bioinformatic community here at Fred Hutch.

- *#data-viz* - Slack channel where you can converse with others across the organization about data visualization
- *#general* - Slack channel used to make announcements, display the weekly calendar, and ask general questions. It’s a great place to have your voice reach the most members
- *#python-user-comm* - Slack channel focused on python users where you can converse with other python users across the organization about approaches, tools, packages, or problems
- *#question-and-answer* - This is the place to ask questions related to scientific computing, bioinformatics, statistics, data sciences, programming or anything technical/academic. And please help us and share your knowledge here as well
- *#r-user-comm* - Slack channel focused on R users where you can converse with other R users across the organization about approaches, tools, packages, or problems

Once joined and viewing a channel make sure to check out the channel’s _details_, _highlights_ and any _pinned items_ which you can see by clicking and viewing channel details as they contain valuable information which may be of help to you. Additionally, you might want to fill out your [profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) on slack as well.
