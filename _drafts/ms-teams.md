Troubleshooting
- You may need to update your security/privacy preferences to allow the software access to your camera and microphone
- There is both a web version and stand-alone application for video chats in Teams. If you're having trouble getting sound or video to work on the web version, try switching browsers (we've had success with Safari and Chrome, but Firefox was problematic).
- Other options for customization can be found in a video session by clicking on the three dots next to the red button to hang up. There you can add blurring the background (useful for when you're working from home!) and adding live captions (this works pretty well, though isn't perfect).

## Other options for virtual and videoconferencing

- Cisco Webex https://www.webex.com
- Zoom https://zoom.us free plan has unlimited 1:1 meetings, but meetings with 3 or more people are limited to 40 minutes
- Google Hangouts
- Slack has messaging capabilities, but only for paid plans (so the Coop Communities Slack can't do this)
