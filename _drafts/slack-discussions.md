In our [previous post](_posts/slack-new.md), we provided a basic introduction to Slack as a communication mechanism and oriented you to Fred Hutch's Coop Communities Slack workspace. A few reminders that are useful even for existing members:
- Fill out your [profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile) to maximize your networking opportunities!
- Find more channels by clicking "Channel" in the lefthand sidebar, and look at the channel details for more information.

Once you have a feel for how Slack works, here are some ideas to customize your workspace and make the most of this resource.

Managing discussions
- A member says something in a channel that you want to converse or add to but _what do you do_? **You start a thread.** [_Threads_](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-) allow you to reply directly to a message, preserve context and encourage conversation without distracting the larger channel's conversational flow. To start a thread, hover over the message in the channel you want to converse about and click the "Start a thread" icon.
- Use threads when appropriate. When responding to an old message, respond in a or to the thread so that it is easier to follow the conversation and doesn’t disrupt other conversations that may be happening in the larger channel
- Post in the appropriate channel based on subject matter, tool, or topic
- Do not double post. Only ask a question once, in the relevant channel but feel free to cross post to other relevant channels by sharing the link to the original post or question

Tagging
- You can use the at sign “@” combined with certain keywords like `@everyone` or `@channel` to alter the way members are notified about the message in which you embed them in. **BUT** with great power comes great responsibility and _there is an etiquette_ to using these `@terms` and they are listed below.
- do not `@` unless you really mean it and it would be of value to the group
- `@channel` - alerts anyone who has joined the channel whether they are online or not
- `@here` - only alerts people who are both in the channel and currently using Slack (ex. time sensitive stuff use this one)
- `@all` - alerts everyone in the group
- `@everyone` - is only to be used in a team’s _#general_ channel
- Tag someone if you are speaking to them using `@` then type in their name

Formatting and post content
- You can also [change your notifications levels](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-guide-to-desktop-notifications) as well
- Format your code properly. When sharing code, use single backticks (`) for short code snippets, and triple backticks (```) for multi-line code snippets
- Want to collect some polling data in the channel for your lab or team? Check out [Polls](https://simplepoll.rocks/faq/) which allows you to conduct polls within the Slack channel
- [Emojis](https://slack.com/help/articles/202931348-use-emoji-and-emoticons)
