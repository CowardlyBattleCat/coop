At the Coop, or the Hutch's [Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en.html), Slack is used to create and support a community of researchers, scientists, post-docs and all groups and individuals within the community interested in bioinformatics and data science. It’s a great place to get support for a particular tool, ask a question, or get guidance from others within the community like yourself.

[Slack](https://slack.com) is also used by many more teams and departments here and abroad to communicate. If you are new to Slack check out our [introduction post here](_posts/slack-new.md).

_Channels_, which most are open, help you organize conversations around a topic or project within the workspace. When you make a channel, then everyone can see the conversation and what is discussed in that channel. It’s a good idea to create channels for different projects, topics, or a conversation between team members. You can also create private channels if you want to have a private discussion with just a few team members. Additionally, you can direct message a member which works like email reaching a member or multiple members quickly and directly.

Click the plus sign next to "Channel" on the sidebar to search for existing channels. Then select the channel of interest you want to join. [Here are some established channels](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/#community-groups) at the Hutch that you may want to join. These channels are design to help create and support the bioinformatic community here at Fred Hutch.

Once joined and viewing a channel make sure to check out the channel’s _details_, _highlights_ and any _pinned items_ which you can see by clicking and viewing channel details as they contain valuable information which may be of help to you.

Here are some ideas to keep supportive communication flowing.

- A member says something in a channel that you want to converse or add to but _what do you do_? **You start a thread.** [_Threads_](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-) allow you to reply directly to a message, preserve context and encourage conversation without distracting the larger channel's conversational flow. To start a thread, hover over the message in the channel you want to converse about and click the "Start a thread" icon.
- You can use the at sign “@” combined with certain keywords like `@everyone` or `@channel` to alter the way members are notified about the message in which you embed them in. **BUT** with great power comes great responsibility and _there is an etiquette_ to using these `@terms` and they are listed below.
- do not `@` unless you really mean it and it would be of value to the group
- `@channel` - alerts anyone who has joined the channel whether they are online or not
- `@here` - only alerts people who are both in the channel and currently using Slack (ex. time sensitive stuff use this one)
- `@all` - alerts everyone in the group
- `@everyone` - is only to be used in a team’s _#general_ channel
- You can also [change your notifications levels](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-guide-to-desktop-notifications) as well
- Use threads when appropriate. When responding to an old message, respond in a or to the thread so that it is easier to follow the conversation and doesn’t disrupt other conversations that may be happening in the larger channel
- Tag someone if you are speaking to them using `@` then type in their name
- Format your code properly. When sharing code, use single backticks (`) for short code snippets, and triple backticks (```) for multi-line code snippets
- Post in the appropriate channel based on subject matter, tool, or topic
- Do not double post. Only ask a question once, in the relevant channel but feel free to cross post to other relevant channels by sharing the link to the original post or question
- Want to collect some polling data in the channel for your lab or team? Check out [Polls](https://simplepoll.rocks/faq/) which allows you to conduct polls within the Slack channel

- Who moderates the communities??? The communities moderate the communities.
