As we all know by now, in an effort to reduce the number of personel on campus Fred Hutch has required that all employees who are able to begin working from home. If you're like me you quickly realized within a day or two that working from bed in your PJs for days on end is not as great as it sounds. Here are some general tips to creating a healthy work/life balance when working from home for an extended period of time!

### Build a Routine:
  * Set work hours and break times for yourself!
  * It might be obvious but keep regular meals.
  * Some folks find it helpful to keep their regular morning routine - getting dressed, etc. Figure out what cues get help you get into 'work mode' and put you in a good mindset.

### Designate a Workspace:
  * Create a clean workspace that isn't the couch or your bed.
  * Set the mood - Add some plants to your space, toss on a podcast or some white noise (I like mynoise.net) to reproduce the feeling of office chatter.
  * Once you have an established routine/working space feel free to be flexible. Work from the porch if it's nice out for a bit. Take a walk between rain showers if you can!

### Communication
  * Ensure that you and your teams are proactive in communicating the best way to get ahold of each other.
  * Consider setting up brief stand-up meetings to check in with your team daily and communicate progress/blockers on projects.
  * Remember you can schedule meetings as often as you see fit.
  * Make sure you are still getting unstructured chat time in!
    * Join virtual community group meetings via Teams
    * Set aside 15 mins prior to meetings to catch up, etc
  * It's the little things that make communication more human
    * Turn on your video during calls - face-to-face interaction is key even if it's through a screen
    * Have some fun - Wear silly hats! Meet eachother's pets!
  * If you don't already - consider setting up a task manager to measure your progress. It's important to celebrate the work you've accomplished and can provide a snapshot of what you're working on to your team. Notion and Trello are some good task managment options.

### Virtual Meeting Etiquette
  * Mute your mic in big meetings.
  * Utilize the screen share feature as needed!
  * If you are leading a meeting be prepared to help guide conversation. Without physical social cues it can be hard to determine speaking order. Ensure that everyone is able to make their thoughts known. It can be as simple as 'Let's hear what Sarah has to say first and then we'll hear from Jon'.
  * Give folks a few seconds to speak up with comments - it can take a moment to unmute yourself.
  * Don't be afraid to speak up if there is a hiccup in reception or someone is not speaking loud enough.
  * Consider recording meetings.
