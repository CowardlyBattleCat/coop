## SciWiki Writer-Editor Program

Here at [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) we are actively involved in data-intensive research and a while back to help support that work we the community [started the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/about/#why-we-started). The [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) is a collaborative and curated collection of resources about data generation and scientific computing created by and for our Fred Hutch research community.

To help foster the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/about/#how-we-write) the community has created a series of [articles](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/about/#articles) and [resource libraries](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/about/#resource-library-entries) to help "on-ramp" readers to the resources available at Fred Hutch. Thus, the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) is created _**by** researchers and staff **for** researchers and staff_. Furthermore, since we are not web designers nor technical writers by training we have opted for a relatively flat organizational structure to the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) and to keep it simple we've decided to [host it on GitHub](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki).

Why am I telling you all this wonderful news? Because we need **YOUR** help! 

We run a [Wiki Writer-Editor program](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/outreach/) for the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) to engage with current researchers and staff and encourage them to write and edit content over a 3-month timeframe about their expertise and approaches. This helps to create an evolving source of documentation for use at Fred Hutch as well as articulate how research processes are performed in general and specifically at Fred Hutch. 

This is a valuable learning experience for those involved especially if you've been unable to do similar work in the past. Researchers in training have in particular used this experience and referenced working on the [Wiki Writer-Editor program](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/outreach/) as evidence of their science communication experience and technical writing chops. We want to encourage more researchers and scientists to do this and so we have added a [contributor page here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/contributors/). In addition to learning and contributing to the community and gaining experience with Git/Github you'll also collect a stipend [$500 for three months of work, ~12 hours per month or ~3 hours per week]. We'll also onboard you in the process of using Github to generate and edit content as well as work in a collaborative environment with Github.

Interested in contributing to the [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/)? I know you are!! Then please review the [responsibilities](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/outreach/#responsibilities) in detail along with the [requirements](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/outreach/#requirements) and send the [application materials](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/outreach/#application-materials) to jburge at fredhutch.org.

Do you have a topic you'd like to see featured here? Would you be interested in writing about something you encounter in your day-to-day work at Fred Hutch? Do you have a writing published elsewhere you'd be willing to let us link or cross-post? Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/FredHutch/coop/issues/36) on GitHub to let us know, or send us an email at coophelp at fredhutch.org.

Thanks for supporting our community, and stay tuned for more information!
