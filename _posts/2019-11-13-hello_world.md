#### Welcome to the Fred Hutch Coop Community blog!

Are you a [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) employee actively involved in data-intensive research? Are you interested in learning more about this type of research? Well, you've come to the right place!

The [Fred Hutch Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org), more commonly known as the Coop, is a community-driven organization of researchers, software developers, and analysts united by a common interest in data-intensive computation and related technical methods. **We build community to share knowledge and accelerate research.**

Who is included in our community? We welcome all Fred Hutch and [SCCA](https://www.seattlecca.org) employees interested in data and computation, from lab managers and faculty to interns and graduate students. Our researchers have job titles ranging from lab technician to data analyst, and are engaged in research that may be clinical, laboratory, or exclusively computational. Even if you're not a Fred Hutch affiliate, we hope you'll find useful information in our online materials.

The Coop began in November 2018 to facilitate community building, assess the data and computation needs of our community, and serve as a one-stop shop for information about resources and activities surrounding data-intensive science at Fred Hutch. We work collaboratively with [other groups at Fred Hutch](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/coop-friends.html) supporting such research and keep our [webpage](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org) public so potential collaborators external to the Hutch can find us. In addition, we support the following programs for our community:
- **Newsletter, email, and listserv:** We publish a newsletter each month to keep our community up to date with the latest opportunities. View past newsletters [here](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/newsletter.html), and email coophelp at fredhutch.org to get added to our listserv or for answers to general questions.
- **Office hours and community groups:** We offer [many opportunities](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/hosted-groups.html) for community members to meet to share knowledge and find answers to technical questions. [Office hours](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/#office-hours) are staffed throughout the week by staff knowledgeable about Fred Hutch data and computational resources. [Community groups](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/#community-groups) provide space for researchers with similar interests in coding or computational methods to share knowledge and skills
- **Coop Community Slack:** Slack is a messaging and discussion application used for collaboration and information sharing. Our [Slack workspace](https://fhbig.slack.com/) includes optional channels for interests ranging from R and Python coding to data visualization.
- **fredhutch.io classes:** [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io) is a project aimed at developing educational resources and structured short-form courses about reproducible computational methods. [Courses](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/) are offered periodically to Fred Hutch and SCCA employees free of charge.
- **Calendars:** We maintain event calendars to assist our community in staying up-to-date on opportunities for participation. Check out the ways to access our event information through Google Calendars, Outlook, and CenterNet [here](https://research.fhcrc.org/coop/en/community/participate.html).
- **Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki:** Our [Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) is a collaborative and curated collection of resources about data generation and scientific computing, created by and for our Fred Hutch research community.

#### Want to contribute to the blog?

We actively encourage the Fred Hutch researcher community itself to write for this blog. The blog is designed to augment the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) which aims to support ongoing biomedical research now and in the future. It does so by creating an evolving source of documentation that grows and changes along with the particular interests and research tools available to Fred Hutch researchers and unifies content that bridges the divide between how research processes are performed in general and how those processes are performed at Fred Hutch specifically. This blog then can help communicate, share, and teach the material covered in the Biomedical Data Science Wiki in a manner that allows the researcher to do so in a linear narrative fashion that is often preferred. If you want to contribute to the blog please contact coophelp@fredhutch.org.
