#### Overview of Community Groups
Community Groups

The Coop is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, and works to share information and resources about computational work across the Hutch. The Coop maintains a listserv, calendars of data science events, and The Coop Communities Slack, supported by FHBig. FHBig is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics Interest Group, a community-based group that hosts a blog and facilitates information sharing among the bioinformatics research community at the Hutch. Hutch employees can learn more through the links above or by emailing coophelp wiht questions or to be added to our email/newsletter list.

The Coop and FHBig also support community groups that meet regularly to discuss topics ranging from basic data literacy skill building to reproducible computational methods. To learn more about what to expect from these meetings, please visit our Community Groups GitHub repository. Current meeting schedules and locations are available on the Google calendar.

#### What they are
Coop community meetings: The Coop hosts community meetings once a quarter to share information from the data science community at the Hutch. Join us to learn about projects and events happening in our community!

Data visualization group: Develops visualizations from data released by TidyTuesday. All programming languages (and even non-coders!) are welcome. See the #data-viz channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

Nextflow group: Discusses issues related to the use of Nextflow (and other workflow managers like Cromwell) at Fred Hutch. The group welcomes Nextflow users of all levels of expertise as well as those just learning about the tool. See the #nextflow channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

Python coding group: Discusses methods of programming in Python and troubleshoots code of participants. Python coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. See the #python-user-comm channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

R coding group: Discusses R packages, R code and troubleshoots code of participants. R coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. See the #r-user-comm channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

Software design group: Discusses issues related to software engineering and interface design and invites speakers on specific topics and participants to share their coding projects. This group is not focused on a specific programming language, but rather on issues common across software projects. See the #software-engineers channel on The Coop Communities Slack for more information.

Technology Exchange: Informal learning forum for employees in technology-focused jobs to share technical skills. This group is most appropriate for individuals who want to discuss the technical details of tools commonly used in positions focused on administration and infrastructure. However, anyone is welcome to attend this forum, and many topics will be relevant to researchers in positions that require technical skills. Subscribe to the TechExchange mailing list for more information.

#### How to start one

Want to create a new community group?
The Coop is happy to support formation of new community groups related to data science activities. We ask that you answer a few questions to guide your planning process:

What are the goals of your group?
Who is interested in participating
Who will lead/facilitate the group?
How often do you want to meet? Some groups meet weekly, every other week, or on the first/second/etc day of the month.
It may help to look at some of the information about existing groups to help get an idea of what has been working for our community so far. You can also post in the Coop Community Slack to gauge interest in the community. Once you are committed to the meeting details, contact one of the Coop team members with the following information:

Title (e.g., "Python coding group")
Description (e.g., "Any Python users (beginner to advanced) are welcome to attend this session and to talk about programming and data analysis in Python. Bring your lunch, your code questions, and your thoughts! Contact this person for more information.")
Open or closed? We prefer community groups to be open to everyone. If you request a group to be closed, we'll add "[closed]" to the title.
Who is the point of contact? We'll need someone to help answer questions about scheduling, etc.
Time and date of the first meeting, and the continued schedule (so we can put a repeat on calendars)
We'll use this information to:

post to the Google and Outlook calendars (we usually don't add community groups to CenterNet)
announce in our monthly newsletter and on Slack
list on our webpage and the training page on the Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki.
